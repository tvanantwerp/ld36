# WMATA Simulator

*An entry to Ludum Dare 36 with the theme "ancient technology".*

No frameworks, no transpiling. Just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Take the reigns at WMATA dispatch and send your repair crews out in a futilte effort to keep this obsolete public transit system running. Any and all bugs are artistically justified as adhering to the spirit of WMATA.
